FA,PS006501,FDA,CMC,5/11/2021,Pre-IND,Question from Sponsor,"1. Does the Agency agree that the proposed release specifications for the Plasmids, and the HEK293T Master and Working Cell Bank are acceptable to support early clinical phase development of this investigational product?","Based on the information provided in your Pre-IND briefing package we have the following comments regarding the proposed release specifications for the Plasmids, and the HEK293T Master and Working Cell Bank: 

1a. Please provide justification for using HEK293T cells, instead of HEK293, which are commonly used to produce AAV clinical vectors. We recommend a switch to HEK293 cells as the production line; considering that the use of HEK293T in manufacturing introduces additional safety concerns related to the presence of residual SV40 T antigen (known to play a role in malignant transformation) in the product. Specifically, SV40 T antigen DNA can be a process residual in the final product, present either as free or packaged DNA. Also, residual SV40 T antigen (protein) can be a contaminating protein in the final product. ",1a)We provide the following justification for the use of HEK293T cells for early clinical studies: (1) decades of studies have failed to reveal any convincing evidence for SV40 playing a role in human cancer; (2) the lack of any evidence for the tumorigenicity as determined from the numerous animal and human studies with vector produced from 293T cells; (3) a safety margin of 1E7 is considered the minimum acceptable threshold and our results demonstrate the safety margin for our product is 1.6 to 2.5 logs above this value; (4) the high cost and long timeline for manufacturing of AAVrh.10 in HEK293 vs HEK293T; we conclude that there is minimal risk associated with the use of an AAV vector produced in 293T cells for human gene therapy. We are currently in the process of developing a manufacturing method that does not include HEK293T cells for later stage clinical development.,Clinical; cell lines,"pind-mtg-bkgrnd.pdf

Does the Agency agree that the proposed release specifications for the Plasmids, and the HEK293T Master and Working Cell Bank are acceptable to support early clinical phase development of this investigational product?","1b. Please provide a risk analysis for the use of HEK293T cells for manufacturing of the clinical product. This analysis should be based on the data for the residual SV40 T antigen fragments in the product lots (made to date with the same manufacturing process as that intended for the clinical lots) and should include a discussion based on the amount and range of the large T antigen fragment sizes that are encapsidated in your AAV product. Your risk analysis should also consider the dose, the target tissue and the patient population. 
","1b)The Sponsorintends to monitor residual levels of SV40 T antigen DNA and has set a n assigned specification of <5E5 copies / 1E13 gc for release of bulk drug substance. Additionally, we have tested a preclinical lot (AAV10FXN-2004-02-DP) by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) using Illumina and PacBio technologies as described in Section 3.2.S.3.1. The results of this testing suggest 0% of reads mapping to the SV40 DNA sequence by both technologies. Based on this information, we believe the SV40 T antigen DNA is low risk and will be monitored in clinical lots.",Clinical; cell lines; risk analysis,"pind-mtg-bkgrnd.pdf

You should set an appropriate release acceptance criterion (AC) for your Residual SV40 Large T Antigen (LTA) DNA test based on data from manufacturing of engineering/development/preclinical lots or from platform manufacturing data, if available. Additionally, release testing should be performed for the size of the packaged host cell DNA. 
","1c)Please see the response to 1b above.

Does the Agency agree that the proposed release specifications for the Plasmids, and the HEK293T Master and Working Cell Bank are acceptable to support early clinical phase development of this investigational product?","1d. We note that your helper plasmid contains the sequence for adenovirus fiber protein, which is a potentially immunogenic protein that has no helper function for AAV production. AAV particles can nonspecifically package plasmid DNA fragments, potentially including the fiber sequence. If you wish to use a helper plasmid that contains the fiber sequence, we have the following recommendations:
i. Please establish an assay to evaluate the amount of fiber DNA sequence
in your product.
ii. If you have information or data (from past manufacturing runs or related
platform manufacturing data) to show that the residual packaged helper
plasmid DNA in vector particles is mostly fragmented and incapable of
expression of fiber, please submit that to the IND.","1d-i)Using the same NGS technologies described in 1b and 1c, preclinical lot AAV10FXN-2004-02-DP was also analyzed for presence of Ad5 L5 fiber DNA sequences. 0.0% of Illumina and 0.1% of Pacbio reads mapped to this sequence (details are available in Section 3.2.S.3.1).

Does the Agency agree that the proposed release specifications for the Cell Harvest Intermediate, Drug Substance and Bulk Drug Substance are acceptable to support early clinical phase development of this investigational product?","Based on the information provided in your Pre-IND briefing package we have the following comments for the proposed release specifications for the Cell Harvest Intermediate, Drug Substance (DS) and Bulk Drug Substance (BDS): 

2a. In general, identity testing should be performed on the final DP in its intended container closure with final labeling adhered. This testing should be able to distinguish your product from similar products manufactured at the CMO, a multiproduct facility, and should include tests that can differentiate both, capsid (serotype) and transgene. In your IND, you should clearly describe how product identity in your final labeled DP is ascertained. Your plan to perform sequencing at the Bulk DS stage may be adequate for Phase 1. However, in your IND, you should clearly describe the procedures put in place at the CMO during DP manufacturing to ensure no cross-contamination occurs with other products made/filled at the facility. ","2a)Testing to confirm capsid identity has been added to the DP release testing panel. Transgene identity using sequencing is performed at the bulk DS stage; however, a transgene specific ddPCR method is now also leveraged at the DP stage as a form of identity testing (see Additional CMC questions/responses 1 and 2 below) in addition to potency tests that ensure the presence of FXN protein expression following transduction with the final DP material. The procedures and testing used to control contamination during the GMP manufacturing process are summarized in Section 3.2.S.2.2 and Section 3.2.P.3.3. ",DP manufacturing,"pind-mtg-bkgrnd.pdf

We note that your DS manufacturing process has defined holds at -65°C at the cell harvest and DS stage for 1 month and 1 year, respectively. We do not agree that your DP stability protocol is sufficient to support these in-process holds during DS manufacture. As part of process development, we recommend that you begin to collect data to demonstrate that the storage of these in-process materials does not have an adverse effect on product quality.","The Sponsor has initiated a stability program to support these holds as described in Section 3.2.S.7.1 for drug substance and in Section 3.2.P.8.1 for drug product.

It is known that FA carriers who do not develop symptoms of FA have non-cardiac peripheral FXN protein levels which range from 30 to 80% of normal (Lazaropoulos et al. 2015). It is anticipated that achieving about 30% of normal human myocardial FXN levels should be potentially curative in these patients. In the MCK mice, a trend of mild improvement was seen at 1.8E11 gc/kg on body weight and survival and this dose produced hFXN levels that were 27% of normal human endogenous levels. Statistically significant improvements were seen at 5.6E11 gc/kg for body weight, survival, and cardiac function and this dose produced hFXN levels that were 73% of normal human endogenous levels. The myocardial FXN expression in response to AAVrh.10FXN treatment in a FA patient’s stressed heart is expected to be similar to the high level of expression in MCK mice treated with AAVrh.10FXN Therefore, these doses should be therapeutic in FA patients.",Nonclinical; dose levels,"pind-mtg-bkgrnd.pdf

Despite very high vector distribution in liver (the highest vector copy number) in NHPs, the hFXN expression was undetectable above the background, and hence was not attempted in other vector positive tissues. The hFXN expression however could only be reliably measured in heart, and shown 6.5% and 37% increases, at 1.2E12 and 3.9E12 gc/kg doses respectively, over the untreated controls.

Does the Agency agree with the basis for justifying the proposed clinical dose range?,We cannot yet agree with your selected clinical dose level range. The proposed starting clinical dose level and dose escalation scheme should be based on: 1) the target level range of FXN activity determined in the murine models of FA and how this range correlates with FXN levels required for correction of FA-associated cardiomyopathy and 2) the preclinical safety and BD profile of LX2006 following intravenous administration.,"9) The detailed justification for proposed clinical doses: 1.8E11 and 5.6E11 gc/kg of AAVrh.10hFXN is provided in Module 2.4.Briefly, these doses are selected based on efficacy (in MCK mice) and safety (in WT mice and NHPs) with the following data/rationale: 
•In the MCK mice, a trend of mild improvement was seen at 1.8E11 gc/kg on body weight and survival; this dose produced hFXN levels that are 27% of normal human cardiac endogenous levels. Statistically significant improvements were seen at 5.6E11gc/kg for body weight, survival, and cardiac function; this dose produced hFXN levels that are 73% of normal human cardiac endogenous levels.  
•FXN levels in peripheral tissues of FA patients with classically presenting disease are 2% to 30% of normal; FA carriers who do not develop symptoms of FA have non-cardiac peripheral FXN protein levels which range from 30% to 80% of normal (Lazaropoulos et al. 2015). Thus, it is estimated that achieving about 30% of normal human myocardial FXN levels would provide clinically meaningful benefit to FA patients. The myocardial FXN expression in response to AAVrh.10FXN treatment in a FA patient’s stressed heart is expected to be similar to the high level of expression in MCK mice treated with AAVrh.10FXN. Therefore, these doses are anticipated to be therapeutic in FA patients.  
•Although the 1.8E11 gc/kg dose was not tested in the WT C57Bl/6 mouse toxicology study, the higher dose of 5.6E11 gc/kg was safe and well tolerated (out to 10 months) (SP-05). In addition, the highest dose (NOAEL) of 3.9E12 gc/kg tested in African green monkeys (out to 3 months) was safe and well tolerated and provided a safety margin of approximately 22- and 7-fold for the 1.8E11 and 5.6E11 gc/kg doses, respectively. 

Collectively, these data support the proposal of 1.8E11 and 5.6E11 gc/kg as the clinical doses and are expected to be safe and efficacious.",Clinical dose ,"pind-mtg-bkgrnd.pdf

However, your submission contains insufficient information to assess the stability of the drug product under conditions that the drug product (DP) will be shipped to the various clinic sites. 

i.We note your description of the drug product shipping process to the clinical sites including temperature excursion monitoring and reporting. However, your description does not include data which demonstrate that the shipping time and conditions used will ensure product sterility, identity, purity, quality, and potency. Please provide data collected to support the shipping of the DP and the diluent.  ","The Sponsor  has  conducted  a  shipping  study  to  demonstrate successful  shipments  of  AAV  drug  product at  the  intended  product  storage  conditions  and  is  preparing  to  repeat  shipping  studies  specifically  for  LX2006  material  and  diluent.  The  data  from  the  previous  shipping  study  and  the  proposed phase appropriate shipping qualification study are discussed below.A previous shipping qualification study was performed by the Sponsor for a representative AAV gene  therapy using  the  same  manufacturing  process,  manufacturing  facility,  and  serotype. The shipping study data comprised of three successful, consecutive shipments to support the shipment of vials from the manufacturer, BGTCF (New York, NY), to a representative clinical depot (PPD Development,  LP,  Orlando,  FL)  (  Table  1).   The Sponsor’s study  confirmed  that  the  shipping  of  representative AAV drug product vials between BGTCF and Orlando, FL did not adversely affect product quality and container closure integrity. Refer to Table 2 for shipping study data. Moreover, the basic transportation unit that used the materials listed in Table 3 was able to maintain the required product storage condition of ≤-65°C throughout the duration of the shipment. Finally, product vials were  returned  to  BGTCF  for  assessment  of  the  vials  for  container  closure  integrity,  and  product  quality was  assessed  using the  same  analytical  methods  used  for  LX2006 release  and  stability  testing. All shipping study criteria was met to support the shipping of DP.  

Proposed Shipping Study for LX2006 Drug Product and Diluent: The  Sponsor  intends  to  conduct  an  additional,  phase  appropriate  shipping qualification  study specific for LX2006 material within the context of the container closure listed in Section 3.2.P.7. The study will aim to confirm the shipping of LX2006 drug product and diluent across the intended shipping  lanes  comprised  of  the manufacturing site (BGTCF),  the  Sponsor’s distribution facility, and a  representative  clinical site.  The  Sponsor  intends to  conduct  a  minimum  of  3  shipments  for  each  shipping  lane  to  qualify  the  shipping  process.  The study will  aim  to  maintain  the  required  product  storage  condition  of  ≤ -65°C  for  LX2006  and  2-8°C  for  diluent  using  similar  shipping  components as listed in Table 3, i.e. GDI 15 shipper (or equivalent) and temperature monitor. The Sponsor will incorporate an appropriately sized phase change shipper for 2-8°C for shipping diluent.The Sponsor will confirm the shipping process does not adversely affect container closure integritytesting the maximum and minimum load for each shipping container and 2x travel time. For at least one test  run,  upon  return  to  BGTCF,  the  drug  product  will  be  tested  to  ensure product  quality  following the  same  analytical  methods  used  for  the  final  product  (Table  4).  Three  successful, consecutive shipments meeting the criteria defined in Table 4will qualify the acceptability of the transportation unit and shipping lane for the LX2006 drug product and diluent.

It appears this procedure is only for research purposes.  Please consider the risks associated with this procedure and making the procedure optional with a separate informed consent that details specific risks associated with obtaining the biopsy and the monitoring required thereafter or provide your rationale for why this procedure is necessary in your study.   ," Cardiac frataxin (FXN) levels (measured from cardiac biopsies) are a key component of the safety-related primary objective of this FIH study. While a substantial safety margin exists for the clinical doses based on nonclinical data, cardiac biopsies are included in this study to assess for cardiac FXN levels within the safety margins. Based on the wild-type mouse toxicology study, cardiac FXN expression of 725% of normal levels was identified to be toxic at a dose of 5.6E12 gc/kg after 10 months (Protocol Section 4.3). Cardiac biopsies will be performed at Screening and at Week 12, the expected timepoint of peak FXN expression. FXN levels in the Week 12 samples will be measured to ensure that they are below the safety threshold (7-fold above normal levels). In addition, evaluation of mitochondrial integrity (via transmission electron microscopy) and histopathology of the biopsy samples will be performed as part of the evaluation for potential FXN-associated toxicity, along with ongoing monitoring of cardiac biomarkers, cardiac signs and symptoms, ECG, echocardiograms, and cardiac MRI. In addition to providing safety information, these biopsy data will provide meaningful insight that will help in the proper design of later phase clinical studies, such as enabling dose selection by establishing a relationship between dose and expression, and also providing a relationship between expression and potential clinical or surrogate endpoints. Therefore, given the need for FXN-associated safety monitoring and the important information regarding dose selection, we believe potential risks associated with this procedure are justified and cardiac biopsies should remain as a required assessment in the study. The risks of the procedure will be minimized through careful selection of the physicians performing the biopsies. Careful monitoring will be performed during and for at least 2 hours post biopsy which will include continuous monitoring of respiratory rate, heart rate, pulse oximetry and ECG, as well as blood pressure and temperature monitoring every 15 minutes.

FA,IND 28133,FDA,Preclinical,5/10/2021,RPDD,IR,,"In your applications, you state that LX2006 is infused intravenously and the rh10 capsid is designed to specifically target delivery to myocardium where it delivers a normal copy of the frataxin gene, which is under-expressed in these FA patients. Belbella et al. (2019), who you cite, note that depending on the vector delivery route and dose administered, the resulting FXN protein level could reach very high levels in the heart, cerebellum, or off-target organs such as the liver. Further, the therapeutic potential of AAV-mediated in vivo gene therapy in preventing and rescuing mitochondrial dysfunction associated with FXN deficiency, both in cardiac and neurological tissues, in animal models has been reported in the literature.

Please explain your reason for limiting LX2006 to the cardiac phenotype. Is this limitation due to the intended intravenous route of delivery of LX2006, i.e., does not cross the blood-brain-barrier, or are there other reasons? ","LX2006 is under development to treat the cardiac component of FA – cardiomyopathy- since its sequelae account for the greatest number of patient deaths (60%, (Tsou 2011). Currently, there is no treatment for cardiomyopathy associated with FA and it therefore represents the greatest unmet medical need for these patients. The effects of frataxin deficiency leading to adverse cardiac outcomes is believed to start in early childhood (Thilenius 1961; Tsou 2011) and early intervention targeting the cardiac muscle will be assessed in pediatric patients once sufficient safety and efficacy has been observed in adult patients.   

Targeting cardiomyocytes for gene therapy of FA is critical for successful treatment of the cardiac phenotype.  LEXEO believes LX2006 has compelling tropism for cardiac muscle via IV administration.  NHP biodistribution studies demonstrated IV LX2006 administration of ~5e12 vg/kg resulted in delivery of ~20 copies/diploid genome in heart compared to <2 copies/diploid genome in brain (Belbellaa 2019).  Data-driven dose selection and IV administration are expected to result in appropriate levels of cardiomyocyte transduction and, consequently, FXN expression in cardiac muscle.  Increased frataxin levels may therefore interrupt or reverse the progression of cardiomyopathy.    ",ROA; phenotype,,FA RPDD IR.pdf,FA RPDD IR.pdf,

LEXEO has no data on the percentage of transduced neurons required to generate therapeutic levels of frataxin.

However, LX2006 when administered intravenously to NHPs, distributes to skeletal muscle also, albeit at substantially lower levels than cardiac muscle (Belbellaa 2019). The doses planned for the clinical trial are relatively low (E11 to E12 vg/kg) for systemic dosing for skeletal muscle disorders, though are adequate for transducing cardiac myocytes.

Outcomes measurements in your completed POC studies were limited to reduction of AP deposits and/or plaque in the hippocampus, which is not sufficient to justify a favorable benefit:risk profile of your proposed FIH clinical trial. 

It is important that you provide more robust POC data in a mouse model of AD that demonstrates the ability of AAVrh.10hAPOE2 to protect against neurodegeneration and cognitive functional impairment. Please conduct an additional POC study to address these gaps. ",The genetic basis for the APOE4-based early onset Alzheimer’s is well established and the strategy for this gene therapy is designed to alter the consequences of APOE4 inheritance with APOE2 expression in the CNS. The mouse studies demonstrate that the hallmark Aβ deposits are markedly reduced by the APOE2 expression. These deposits are recognized as an early event in the Alzheimer’s pathogenesis. In conjunction with the discussion in Section 8of the IND that changes in mouse AD-related pathology do not correlate with human AD-based cognitive decline indicate that clearance of plaques in mouse models represent the single best surrogate for efficacy. We therefore have not tested the vector for improvement in cognitive function. It is noted that the recent 2018 FDA draft guidelines identify the use of biomarkers (such as plaques) for clinical evaluation of candidate drugs since cognitive evaluations require clinical trials with unsustainably long timelines and the meaningfulness of measured changes may not be apparent. Similar arguments apply to the use of animal behavior assays.

To evaluate neuropathology of APOE2 gene delivery resulting from over expression of APOE2, brain sections from PDAPP mice injected with AAVrh.10hAPOE2 or the control vector AAVrh.10mCherry were stained with cresyl violet and the cell numbers were quantified. No differences were observed in gross hippocampal morphology in mice treated with AAVrh.10hAPOE2 or AAVrh.10mCherry or the stained cells. Sections were also stained with Fluoro-Jade B, a fluorochrome that specifically detects dead or degenerating neurons. Wild-type (uninjected mice) or wild-type mice treated with kainic acid were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. No Fluoro-Jade B positive staining was observed in brain sections from PDAPP mice treated with either AAVrh.10hAPOE2 or AAVrh.10mCherry and sacrificed after 8 wk.

Summary: The Sponsor stared that assessment of cognitive memory function and/or neurobehavioral outcomes measurements in mouse models of AD are unlikely to generate data that ore interpretable or relevant to the clinical scenario. ","FDA explained that the underlying pathogenesis of AD is stlll being explored, and it is unknown whether the presence of amyloid plaques cause AD or whether they are just a by-product of the AD process. Thus, POC data limited to showing a reduction of amyloid beta plaque levels in mice following administration of AAVrh.10hAPOE2 will not be sufficient to support a favorable benefit: risk profile of this product in the proposed clinical trial. 

The FDA clarified that the recommended hybrid POC study in reodents should also collect comprehensive safety information. The conduct of any large animal studies [eg. non-human primates (NHPs)] beyond any proposed pilot studies should only be considered if the specific safety concerns cannot be feasibly addressed in AD mice (e.g. safety related to entohinal cortex/huppocampus route of administration).",,POC; preclinical,2015-10-14 Pre-IND final meeting minutes Fax.PDF,,pg38-53 Sn0000 IND18406 Original IND Ron Crystal.pdf,

In section 8 we present our proposed initial clinical study. Do you have any general concerns over the proposed design? ,"10i. Treatment-emergent suicidality (suicidal ideation and behavior) has been identified in recent years as a concern for a number of drugs and drug classes. Given the heightened concern regarding the potential for treatment-emergent suicidality with certain drugs, particularly those products with central nervous system activity, we have determined that prospective assessments for suicidality should be included ln clinical trials involving all drugs tor neurological Indications. There are two primary reasons for this new requirement pertaining to prospective suicidality assessments. 

1.The prospective assessments will ensure the collection of more timely, complete, and reliable data pertaining to suicidality than have been collected in the past. This will allow assessment of the risk for suicidality with a given drug and, when the data are collected in a systematic and uniform fashion, will allow for additional analyses to be conducted in the future aggregating findings and comparing findings across drugs and drug classes. 

2.The prospective assessments will help ensure that patients who are experiencing suicidal thoughts or behavior are properly recognized and adequately managed. This is important whether or not a particular product is known or suspected to be associated with treatment-emergent suicidality. 

We acknowledge that there are significant limitations to reliably assess suicidality in patients with cognitive impairment, especially when such impairment is more pronounced. We also concede that those limitations exist even when suicidality is rated based not only on the report of the patient, but also on information obtained from the caregiver or other individual familiar with the patient. However, despite those limitations, and the current lack of a consensus as to how suicidality might best be evaluated in those with cognitive impairment, we do believe, and the medical literature suggests, that attempts to serially assess suicidality in a systematic manner are worthwhile in clinical trials in mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease, to monitor the safety of your product during those trials. The instrument (or combination of instruments) used for this purpose should incorporate individual items derived from a standard scale used to assess suicidality, with each item rated after structured interviews of both patient and caregiver (or other party familiar with the patient) and with an additional global (categorical) rating by the evaluating clinician of whether the patient appears suicidal or not suicidal at the same time point. An example of a standard instrument from which the aforementioned items might be derived is the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), but alternative instruments may also be appropriate for the same purpose. You can obtain information about the C-SSRS from Dr. Kelly Posner at Columbia University (posnerk@childpsych.columbia.edu.",The C-SSRS suicide-related instrument has been included in the protocol in Section 6. ,Suicide; safety; protocol,2015-10-14 Pre-IND final meeting minutes Fax.PDF,,pg38-53 Sn0000 IND18406 Original IND Ron Crystal.pdf,

Residual Host Cell DNA Assay
A quantitative, fluorescent probe PCR assay is used for the detection of residual HEK293TDNA. The assay steps are DNA extraction, purification, and concentration, as well as an amplification step to detect and quantitate any DNA present. The standard curve is generated using serial dilutions of genomic DNA isolated from a 293 human cell line, with a range of 0.1 pg to 7800 pg per reaction. Amplifications are performed using synthetic oligonucleotide primers and an internal oligonucleotide probe specific for DNA sequences within a conserved region of the genome. The following controls are used for this assay: BSA (5 ng/mL) in 0.85% sodium chloride as a negative control, BSA spiked with 100 ng of human DNA standard as a positive control, and water substituted for DNA template as a reagent control. The limit of quantificationof this assay is 0.5 pg of human DNA/rxn. A validation study performed by Charles River Laboratories demonstrated specificity for human DNA in matrices derived from model protein solutions of 5 mg/2ml and 20 mg/2ml.  

Residual Host Cell Protein Assay
Residual HEK293T protein in drug substance is determined by ELISA using a commercially available test kit (Cygnus Technologies). The assay uses six standards of pre-diluted HEK293 host cell protein ranging in concentration from 0 to 200 ng/ml. The 0 ng/ml standard serves as the negative control. The limit of quantification in this assay is 0.4 ng/ml. The test is specific to human proteins and according to the manufacturer there is no cross reactivity to proteins arising from FBS, which aside from benzonase and Tryple Select is the only other source of protein in this production.  

Residual Benzonase Assay
Residual benzonase is determined by ELISA using a commercially available test kit (EMD Millipore). The standard curve is prepared using benzonase ranging from 0.197 ng/ml to 50 ng/ml. Positive controls incbude benzonase endonuclease standard at 5 ng/ml and a spike control of 5 ng/ml benzonase standard added to post-benzonase treatment samples at 1:4 and 1:8 dilutions. Growth medium used for samples or pre-benzonase treated samples serves as the negative control. The limit of quantification in this assay is 0.4 ng/ml.

10.1.Serum neutralizing anti-AAVrh10 antibody assay","We will use the SOP from our previous clinical trial for an AAVrh.10- based gene therapy for Batten disease (BB IND#13951). Briefly, AAVrh.10 neutralizing antibodies refer to the subset of anti-AAVrh.10 antibodies that inhibit expression of the AAVrh.10 transgene. The most common mechanism of inhibition is physical binding to the capsid in a manner that blocks or impedes cellular update. This assay uses AAVrh.10Luc, a luciferase reporter AAV construct, and HEK 293ORF6 cells, which complement E1/E4 deletions in the virus to assess the presence of neutralizing antibodies. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies, AAVrh.10Luc can infect 293ORF6 cells and produce a luciferase signal which can be quantified by luminescence. By pre-incubating AAVrh.10Luc with serum containing AAVrh.10 neutralizing antibodies, the signal will be suppressed based on the concentration of antibodies capable of binding and inhibiting infectivity and/or transgene expression. The human serum being tested is first heat inactivated to inactivate components of the complement system which can impede the assay. The levels of neutralizing antibody is expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution at which 50% inhibition of the positive AAVrh.10Luc signal. We will provide the details of this assay as an amendment to the IND (Attachment 2b =p82 of additional file). It is not clear what the “specificity” for this assay means, neutralizing antibodies arising from other vector serotypes that cross react with the AAVrh.10 vector are relevant and the contribution of these antibodies to the neutralizing titer is important to include. The assay has been qualified to the extent that the precision of the results for the positive and negative controls have been tracked and shown to be reproducible. Sensitivity of the method is not yet possible given the lack of a gold standard. ",,,Sn0001 IND18506 Response to information.pdf,Sn0000 IND18406 Original IND Ron Crystal.pdf,

Regarding the surgical procedure, a description of the intracisternal administration procedure is provided below. 

Preprocedure  
MRI with and without contrast for navigational planning is performed prior to the procedure to confirm candidacy for intracisternal injection and to plan potential trajectories and needle depths prior to the procedure.  

Day of Procedure 
Patient is sedated and intubated and then rotated into a prone position for the procedure. 
The inferior occiput/superior neck is shaved as needed.  
A CT with contrast (CT angiogram) is performed to identify the occiput, C1 arch and any major blood vessels which might be within the path of the planned trajectory.  
A radiopaque marker is placed on the skin to identify the potential entry point with either CT fluoroscopy or limited CT slices performed to identify the marker. This is adjusted as needed with additional images until the desired entry point is confirm.  
The entry point is marked and the skin is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The skin is infiltrated with 0.5-1ml of 1% lidocaine.  
A 3 inch 18 or 20G spinal needle is then passed through the cervical musculature until it is just dorsal to the C1 arch at the level of the occipitocervical junction based upon the planned trajectory. When the trajectory has been confirmed with CT fluoroscopy/CT imaging, a 5 inch 22G spinal needle is passed through the guide needle and the tip is gradually extended with intermittent CT imaging until the tip penetrates the dura and the subarachnoid space. CSF flow along with CT imaging will confirm entry into the cisterna magna. If needed, CT contrast agent can be infused to confirm either the epidural or subdural space. Following confirmation of CSF flow, a short extension tubing is attached to the 22G spinal needle and CSF flow is used to flush air from the catheter. A three way stop valve is attached to the tubing to facilitate CSF collection followed by infusion of the gene therapy solution.

Due to variability in transduction of neurons between different species using various serotypes of AAV (Bunnell et al., Mol Ther, 2004, 9, Supplement 1, Sl29 and Vite et al. Gene Ther. 2003, 10, 1874-81)26, and the possibility of pre-existing immunity to AA Vrh.10 in African green monkeys, we propose to proceed with the human clinical study regardless of any evidence for TPP-I expression in non-human primates. Do you agree? ","Although pre-existing immunity to AA Vrh.10, if seen in the monkeys, represents only one possible reason for why TPP-1 expression may not be observed in the nonhuman primates (NHPs). An immune response to the TPP-1 transgene product may also lead to decline ofTPP-1 expression. Figure 9 on page 14 of the preIND package depicts significant levels ofTPP-l activity in various nontarget tissues of CLN2 Tg mice, such as the liver, serum, and spleen, following injection of2xl010gc of AVVrh. l0cuhCLN2 into the brain, compared to normal (wild type) mice. Thus the potential for notable TPP-1 overexpression following injection into normalNHPs exists, and this overexpression might lead to the induction of an immune response to TPP-1. Therefore, we cannot provide an answer to this question until all the preclinical data are reviewed following submission of the IND.

Are the designs of the rat and non-human primate toxicology studies as described in section 6 adequate in regard to dose, time and parameters to be assessed? ","Based on the information provided in the preIND package, we cannot agree that the design of the rat and NHP studies is adequate. 
1. You have not provided any information regarding the vector biodistribution and trans gene expression profile of the in vivo administration of AAVrh.10hCLN2. Therefore, it is not known whether the proposed study duration of 90 days and the proposed sacrifice time points of 7 and 90 days will adequately capture the potential toxicities of this product. In addition, the data by Mori, S et al. [Mori, S, et al. (2004) Two novel adeno-associated viruses from cynomolgus monkey: pseudotyping characterization of capsid protein. Virology 330:375- 83.] suggest that AA V2 and AAVl0 have very distinct capsid proteins. The two vectors don't share a similar biodistribution (BD) pattern when administered intravenously in mice. You have not provided any data to show that the long-tenn safety profile is comparable between AA Y2 and AA Yl 0 vectors. Thus, we don't agree with your statement on page 19 of the meeting package that' ... the rat study is focused primarily on short term safety related to the delivery vehicle on the premise that, as described above, long term safety of the delivered genome (AA V2) has already been established by previous rat, non-human primate and human studies.' Please perform a BD study in rats in order to support the design of the toxicology studies and to provide better correlation between vector presence and transgene expression in the CNS and in nontarget tissues. 
a.	The BD study should incorporate the route, number of injection sites and location of injection sites that can best represent the clinical scenario.
b.	Please determine the level and persistence of vector locally in the CNS and systemically in serum, heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, gonads, spinal cord, CSF, eyes, and muscle. Several time points should be included in order to capture the kinetic profile of vector distribution. Please analyze the samples using RT-PCR that meets our current sensitivity standard with detection S50 copies of vector/µg of genomic DNA.
c.	Please assess the level and persistence of transgene expression in the same tissues analyzed for vector presence.","Sponsor Response: Due to endogenous TPP-1 activity in these normal animals, determination of TPP-1 activity due to product administration would be hard to determine. 
FDA Response: It is important to collect data to correlate vector presence and transgene expression. 
Sponsor Response: Sponsor agreed to perform the BD study and will use the results of the study to support the design of the toxicology studies that will use both in rats and non-human primates.

1.	A small length of polyethylene tubing is used to attach a syringe needle to a 6 foot length of the glass capillary tubing and the whole assembly is flushed with ethanol, sterile water, and then sterile filtered air to dry. The assembly is then packaged in a sterilization pouch along with the syringe barrel and plunger separated and is gas sterilized.  A disposable tube containing ferrules and spare syringe needles in also sterilized.
2.	Separately empty sterilization pouches and the sterile box are steam sterilized.
3.	In a sterile laminar flow hood using sterile technique, the syringes are filled with the vector solution including appropriate overage for dead volume and system flush.  The filled syringe is then attached to the catheter and the injection assembly is flushed with the first 35 microliters of vector which is retained in the GMP facility.  The
syringe/catheter assembly is then placed into new sterile bag which is placed in a sterile box (Attachment 3).
4.	The sterile box is brought to the operating room and placed on a roller table (Attachment 4). The scrub nurse reaches into the box (whose contents are sterile) and removes the filled syringes one at a time and passes them to the surgeon.
5.	The surgeon secures the injection catheter in the sterile field and passes the syringe to the pump operator.  The syringe/catheter assembly is mounted onto the syringe pump
(Attachment 5).

A primary concern of residual plasmid DNA sequences packaged within AAV particles is the possibility of the unintended expression of immunogenic peptides, oncogenic potential, and transfer of prokaryotic sequences, such as antibiotic resistance genes. Previous studies evaluating residual plasmid in HEK based AAV material support the trace DNA is unlikely to be transcribed and elicit host immune response (Hauck, 2009). In addition, plasmids have been extensively used in non-viral gene therapy approaches in various clinical trials. As stated in FDA Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee (CTGTAC) Meeting #70 Toxicity Risks of Adeno-associated Virus (AAV) Vectors for Gene Therapy briefing document “While it is often possible to quantitate the amounts of various DNA impurities in AAV vector preparations, it is currently not known whether these impurities significantly increase the risk of oncogenicity.

Given a 100kg patient and a 10mL total dose, the worst case scenario calculation result is 1 μg of total HCP/dose. Typical levels in gene therapy trials where no or limited safety concerns were raised are in the 0.5-50 μg/dose range (Tanaka, 2020).

A method to assess residual DNA safety was presented as part of risk assessment to evaluate the suitability of HEK293T cells for manufacturing (discussed in Section 3.2.S.2.3.6.1). This method (Yang, 2013) was based on a mechanistic modeling of the relationship between the risk and characteristics of the purification process including DNA inactivation, biological nature of the host cells such as the numbers and sizes of oncogenes, and number of oncogenes. Using the equation proposed by Yang et al., we calculated the Safety Margin for an oncogenic event to happen in the worst case-scenario of dosing 2.8E6 E1a copies/dose would be 9.8E7 (~1 log above the minimal threshold of 1E7 established by the WHO for safety margin of an oncogenic event).

Based on this specification, a maximum dose of 10 mL would equate to a worst-case scenario of 5 ng per dose. A previous risk assessment by Tanaka et al. was performed supporting the proposed specification as endogenous DNase I exists in human serum at 3.2 ng/mL (Prince, 1998), which corresponds to 17 μg/human (calculated assuming human blood as 1/13 of weight and 70 kg human). Additionally, recombinant human DNase I (rhDNase) was approved as a biological product (Pulmozyme®) for cystic fibrosis with a maximum dosage of the product was 2.5 mg twice daily.  A minimum rhDNase concentration of 50–100 ng/ml (269–538 μg/human) was required to achieve detectable catalytic activity in serum. Moreover,adverse reactions attributed to Pulmozyme® are rare (<1/1000) and mild in most cases (Shire 2002).

Provide a strong justification for how the host cell DNA levels in the drug product meet the WHO recommended guideline of 10 ng/dose.  ,"The Sponsor manufacturer, BGTCF, has extensive gene therapy experience with the proposed manufacturing process and,  to date, has not observed any safety risks   attributed to host cell DNA levels in pre-clinical and clinical studies.   To provide with further justification for host cell DNA level safety, the E1a DNA levels, for which more data and a specification are available (<5E5/1e13 GC), is leveraged as a representative test for host cell DNA until more data is gathered with the updated host cell DNA method (The E1a   adenovirus gene is stably integrated and expressed in HEK293 cells and participates in transactivation of some viral promoters, allowing these cells to produce high levels of protein). Lot AAV10FXN-2004-BDS showed 93 copies of E1a/μL, which is equivalent to 138 ng/mL of total residual DNA (using an approximate conversion factor based on 6.6 E1a copies per cell and 9.8 pg of DNA per HEK293T cell from Merten, 2010). Following a similar approach as in Question 3B, the Safety Margin calculated based on this total DNA level is 3E8, which is >1 log above the minimal 1E7 safety threshold. Due to difficulties in efficiently reducing host cell DNA levels appropriately to accommodate the doses required in the clinical trial, the residual host cell DNA per dose is likely to remain in the order of ng to μg depending on the administration dose. Several previously published risk assessments support the fact that these levels of DNA should be considered as a low safety risk. Sheng-Fowler et al.showed that even though 100 μg of cellular DNA derived from human tumor-cell lines was inoculated into mice, oncogenic activity was not detected (Sheng-Fowler, 2014).   In addition, a prior risk assessment for AAV gene therapies was conducted and concluded existing regulatory guidelines regarding host cell DNA limits may require re-consideration for gene therapy products based on the unique characteristics of AAV particles (Wright, 2014).

Compatibility studies currently include quality measurements for genome copy titer and infectious titer. Additional potential stability-indicating quality attributes should be considered, including subvisible particulate matter and aggregation (3.2.P.2.6).    

Stability studies
The drug product stability data currently provided consists of a small subset of important quality attributes (3.2.P.8). The proposed GMP long-term stability studies, while more extensive, currently do not include the potential stability indicating measurement of subvisible particulate matter and should be included (3.2.P.8.1, p2).  ","LEXEO explained that in our experience subvisible particulates are not stability indicating. SEC is a much more sensitive and informative way to detect product aggregation. In addition, the particulate testing requires a relatively large amount of material from the batch. Health Canada explained that while SEC may detect early reduction in product quality, it doesn’t address other potential subvisible particles. Therefore, subvisible particle testing should be included. If product volume is a significant concern, Health Canada suggested that accelerated stability studies could inform if subvisible particle testing is stability indicating and/or the sponsor could consider subvisible particle testing at fewer intervals during the stability study may help to minimize the sampling burden.",Compatability testing; stability ,0005-ca-m105-meeting-summary-20220211.pdf,0005-ca-m105-meeting-summary-20220211.pdf,0005-ca-m105-meeting-summary-20220211.pdf,

•A CoA of at least one clinical batch
•Testing results for the toxicological batch according to the proposed clinical specifications in 3.2.S.4.1, and where possible, a side-by-side comparison of the clinical and toxicology batches
•A discussion of the characterization results described in 3.2.S.3.1 for the toxicology batches used

Safety-based justifications should demonstrate an understanding of the risk associated with each impurity and a description on how these risks are managed. 

The following is a high overview of issues identified. (see link)","LEXEO explained that some of the impurities are commonly used clinical drugs and it seems confusing to us that there are concerns regarding the very low residual levels found in the product. LEXEO also questioned if there is  a specific range that is desired or are there specific references that Health Canada would like us to consider.  LEXEO also inquired about the best way to use our prior clinical experience to better justify impurity specifications. 

Health Canada responded that they would like to see a better justification for the no adverse effect level of each impurity and how the established specification relates to that level.  They also stated that not all of the literature references provided were suitable for the intended purpose for which they were being cited and that more appropriate references would help.

LEXEO asked for clarification around product specific impurities (such as residual transgene plasmid) where literature and/or clear precedent does not exist for the specific impurity.  Health Canada responded that in some cases, such as for residual plasmid impurities, you can generalize the information available even though it is not for your specific plasmid.  For example, for single stranded AAV there are references that state that these can be reduced to 1-8% of starting values or even 1-3%.  Therefore, values above these numbers are probably not appropriate.",Impurities; references,0005-ca-m105-meeting-summary-20220211.pdf,0005-ca-m105-meeting-summary-20220211.pdf,0005-ca-m105-meeting-summary-20220211.pdf,

However, Health Canada requests a table that describes all changes made from the toxicology batches to the clinical batch, including a description of how the risk-based impact does or does not affect the product quality or consistency.  Post-NOC guidance should be used as a tool to gage and assess the risk of any changes made to the manufacturing process. 

Please note, the addition of steps during manufacturing (i.e. buffer exchanges), scale-ups from the previous 22.8 mL, and significant changes to the control strategy, are considered substantial changes and will require supporting data. ","LEXEO shared that that we have extensive experience manufacturing AAVrh.10 vectors in our manufacturing facility; both in terms of process and scale.  With that experience we have developed an understanding of which changes are likely to have an impact on the manufacturing process.  Based on our experience, we believed   that the changes we were implementing were very minorand therefore we did not provide extensive justification and comparability data. Health Canada replied that it would have been helpful if more of that explanation was included in the submission to help Health Canada understand if there was a risk-based approach to decision making and how it was determined that the planned changes were unlikely to impact critical quality attributes.  LEXEO then asked if platform data, using the same vector and process to manufacture a similar product, could be used as supportive information.  Health Canada explained that they accept platform data.  However, LEXEOwould need to address the differences between products used in supporting studies and justify why it would be relevant to the existing product.",Comparability data; manufacturing process,0005-ca-m105-meeting-summary-20220211.pdf,0005-ca-m105-meeting-summary-20220211.pdf,0005-ca-m105-meeting-summary-20220211.pdf,
